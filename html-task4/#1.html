        <h3>Model S</h3>
        <p>Model S is built from the ground up as an electric vehicle, with high-strength architecture and a floor-mounted battery pack allowing for incredible impact protection.
            Only Tesla has the technology that provides dual motors with independent traction to both front and rear wheels for unparalleled control, in all weather conditions. As a result, Model S instantly controls traction and torque to every wheel, with a unique and superior all-wheel drive system.

        <h3>Model 3</h3>
        <p>Safety is the most important part of the overall Model 3 design. The metal structure is a combination of aluminum and steel, for maximum strength in every area. In a roof-crush test, Model 3 resisted four times its own mass, even with an all-glass roof: that's the same weight as two full-grown African elephants.
            Model 3 comes with the option of dual motor all-wheel drive, 20” Performance Wheels and Brakes and lowered suspension for total control, in all weather conditions. And a carbon fiber spoiler improves stability at high speeds, all allowing Model 3 to accelerate from 0-60 mph in as little as 3.2 seconds.

        <h3>Model X</h3>
        <p>Model X is one of the safest SUVs ever. Built from the ground up as an electric vehicle, the body, chassis, restraints and battery technology provide a very low probability of occupant injury.
            Model X has the most storage room of any SUV in its class, comfortable seating for up to seven adults and the capability to tow up to 5,000 pounds. Falcon Wing doors are equipped with sensors to monitor the proximity of surroundings, and can open in even the tightest parking spaces.

        <h3>Model Y</h3>
        <p>Like every Tesla, Model Y is designed to be the safest vehicle in its class. The low center of gravity, rigid body structure and large crumple zones provide unparalleled protection.
            Model Y provides maximum versatility—able to carry 7 passengers and their cargo. Each second row seat folds flat independently, creating flexible storage for skis, furniture, luggage and more. The liftgate opens to a low trunk floor that makes loading and unloading easy and quick.
